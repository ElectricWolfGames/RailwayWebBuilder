        Paragraph1 = "The Class A4 is a class of streamlined 4-6-2 steam locomotive designed by Nigel Gresley " +
            "for the London and North Eastern Railway in 1935. Their streamlined design gave them high-speed capability as well as making " +
            "them instantly recognisable, and one of the class, 4468 Mallard, holds the world record as the fastest steam locomotive. " +
            "Thirty-five of the class were built to haul express passenger trains on the East Coast Main Line route from London Kings Cross via " +
            "York to Newcastle, and later via Newcastle to Edinburgh, Scotland. They remained in service on the East Coast Main Line until " +
            "the early 1960s when they were replaced by Deltic diesel locomotives; they themselves proving to be worthy successors to the A4s. " +
            "Several A4s saw out their remaining days until 1966 in Scotland, particularly on the Aberdeen – Glasgow express trains, " +
            "for which they were used to improve the timing from 3.5 to 3 hours.";
