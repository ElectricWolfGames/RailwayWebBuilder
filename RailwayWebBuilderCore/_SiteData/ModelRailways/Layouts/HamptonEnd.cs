            Description = "Hampton End was a small branch line link serving a small village (Hampton End). Most of the freight that used the line was fish from the quayside, After the closure of the line many years ago, a group of local rail enthusiasts rein- stalled the track & buildings & purchased a few foreign engines & stock. Most weekends trains can be seen running. The buildings are from BR days. This international flair works well. Most of the trees are supplied by Ceynix Trees. Buildings are supplied by T&M models. Hampton End is supported by Fyna Vehicle Hire.";
