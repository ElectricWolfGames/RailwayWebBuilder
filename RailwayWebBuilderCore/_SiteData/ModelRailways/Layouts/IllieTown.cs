        Description = "Illie Town is a small modern image layout based in Cheshire. Passenger services are operated by ARRIVA WALES and EAST MIDLANDS. On the freight side, there is a ballast siding and a warehouse that imports steel, which are served by a variety of locos from different companies. There is a two-road loco depot with a separate fuelling point. The layout is over 20 years old and has been on the exhibition circle previously known as Bridge Street but a lot of work has gone into making it Illie Town. Though the track plan is pretty much the same, we added the bay platform, fueling point and warehouse for added interest, along with new background scenery. Fully wired for DCC and controlled by NCC power cab, all turnouts and signals are by normal analogue.";
