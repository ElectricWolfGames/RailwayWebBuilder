            Description = "Beddgelert Junction is a village station situated in Snowdonia. North Wales. The layout is a sort of 'What if\". that being 'What if the Welsh Highland Rail-way had been a success & lasted into the 1950's & Ws' The track plan is loosely based on the station as it was in the 1920's with the addition of a bay platform to serve trains coming down from the fictional Llantrevelyn branch. Stock is a mix of kit built, scratch built & R-T-R depicting mainly Welsh Highland but also the odd Ffestiniog service. Buildings are all scratch built & based on real structures. ";
