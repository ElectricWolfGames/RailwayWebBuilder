        Description = "Burton on Trent was famous for two things Beer and Railways, at its peak there were over 30 Breweries in the town. Many brewers from across the country built their breweries here to access the waters of the Trent, at this point the gypsum content in the water allows for successful use of a greater amounts of hops. Hops, as well as flavoring beer, are a natural pre-servative, allowing beer to travel further, meaning beers from burton could survive the long journey across the British Empire to places as far as India. This Model shows the Trent Brewery, which was built by Thomas Sykes in 1881, its 50 em-ployees could produce around 20,000 barrels annually. In 1893, the brewery was re-named the Trent Brewery. This 00 Gauge Model shows the whole brewing operation from around 1950, from the malt intake to the cask racking and bottle Line, along with the daily movements of wagons across the brewery railway system.";
