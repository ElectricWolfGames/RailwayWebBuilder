        Description = "Scale model of the former Sutton in Ashfield town station on Outram St. in the 1950's. The station was built by the Great Northern Railway (GNR) as part of their Leen Valley Extension which enabled trains to run from Nottingham Victoria to Shirebrook North via Sutton-in-Ashfield Town, Skegby, Pleasley East and Shirebrook South. The line was closed on 27 May 1968 and the station was demolished to make way for the Asda supermarket which still stands on the site today.";
