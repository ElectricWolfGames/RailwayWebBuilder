            Description = "Hartley Poole Too is set fictitiously somewhere on the Somerset Levels in the middle years of the Second World War. The central feature is a coal-fired power station, with modellers' licence allowing an early form of merry-go- round bringing coal in to the site and taking ash away in the “same” train. The power station has a cooling tower which has live steam emitted from it. </br>" +
                "  The boiler room has a chimney emitting real smoke. To the east lies an army camp which houses a variety of military vehicles prior to D-Day 1944, and boasts hospital and NAFFI Nissen huts. The camp is served by a small country station which has a two-track GWR main line, off which a siding can accommodate such wagons as tank-transporting warwells and warflats. To the west lies a battery of anti- aircraft guns with two functioning search lights. Towards the rear is a rifle range. At the far end is a shot-down German aircraft which has crashed into a cottage with smoke emanating from it. The pilot awaits capture by advancing Home Guard.</br></br>" +
                "  Against the scenic break board runs a high level shuttle for a diesel railcar. The line appears from off- stage on the west and runs along an embankment, behind the power station, over an arched viaduct to a high level halt at the east end. A detached’ siding serves a gunpowder store. In the foreground is a river scene with naval craft and bankside railway tracks for militia.";
