            Description = "Set in the late 1980s, SPLOTT is a fictional representation of a small transfer yard (named after the local suburb of Cardiff) located next to Cardiff Tidal Sidings and Tremorfa Steelworks. The model aims to showcase the variety of freight stock and locomotives seen in the south wales area around that time. The track work is built to 18.83mm (P4) track gauge and utilises DCC to control the locomotives. The points are controlled by conventional switching. The layout utilises the Dingham automatic uncoupling system together with electromagnets below the track. Most of the structures on the layout have been handmade using plastic sheet, styrene profiled sections or specially designed etched brass components. Detailing parts come from a variety of sources including Europe and the USA. Locomotives have been detailed using Extreme Etchings detailing parts and much of the stock is either scratch built or heavily modified. All stock on the layout has been weathered to varying degrees.";
