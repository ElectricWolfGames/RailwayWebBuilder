            Description = "Axmouth is the result of a holiday in Devon and researching the network of ex-LSWR/ SR lines in east of the county. Although we are mainly BR-Blue modellers, an SR liveried Hornby M7 was purchased (lovely mode) so a layout was needed to run it on. </br></br>" +
                " The track plan of the terminus at Seaton offered good operating potential; main platform, bay, engine shed and goods yard. This also had an interesting location right along the river estuary. However rather than simply follow this plan, we have made Axmouth a *mirror-image' to place it on the opposite bank - the name Axmouth was chosen as it sounds suitable railway-like and the river is next to the Axe. Other SR stock was added to the fleet so the setting for Axmouth is in the late-1930s. </br></br>" +
                " The two baseboards are 18\" x 36\" giving a 6' scenic length so the Seaton plan had to be compressed - the real thing could accommodate quite long holiday trains. However, the main platform can still take a three coach branch train plus a T9. The buildings are from the Bachmann \"Shillingstone\" range and add nicely to the SR country feel. We both have an interest is SR EMU's so Axmouth has been given 3rd rail but just into the bay - this is part of a SR test for rural electrification. Had the second war not intervened, much more of the ex-SR lines would have been electrified. Anyway it is an excuse to run the superb Hornby 2-BIL.";
