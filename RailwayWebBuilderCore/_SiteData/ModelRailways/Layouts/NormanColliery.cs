            Description = "Norman Colliery was born out of a need to have somewhere to shove wagons about with my growing collection of early design diesel shunters. The baseboards where originally mad for a OO continuous run 12' x 8' layout that never materalised. They were converted to a | 16' x 2' scenic layout with a 72' exchange yard.  The premise is that the colliery is at the end of its life with the lower screens closing down and only the top screens in use. The only problem is that feeder road to the upper screens has been closed by subsidence so a link line had to be made to the lower line. This gave me the multi-level layout that you do not often see in O gauge.  The engines are all kit built from various manufacturers except one 03 from Brassworks. The wagons are all kits, mainly Parkside Dundas with a couple of Slaters and Piercy.  The colliery buildings are all scratchbuilt from foamboard with brick and stonework from Slaters and window frames from Highland castings. The track is all Peco, the point motors are from Conrad.";
