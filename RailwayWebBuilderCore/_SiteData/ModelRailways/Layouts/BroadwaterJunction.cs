        Description = "It's the 1950s and Britain's railways are beginning to be modernised. At Broadwater Junction the station has been wiped away and the track layout has been simplified. The old pre-grouping signal box has been replaced with a new BR design. The only remnant of the area's history is the old wooden wharf rotting away in the mud. Once a point of transshipment for the branch's products, its lack of road access and position on a tidal inlet was always a disadvantage, and when its track connection to the station was removed, it and its old crane were totally abandoned. The signal box model is a removable module and other company signal boxes can be put in place to increase the variety of rolling stock which can be operated, so as to accommodate all the different companies and period models that club members hold. The layout's first appearance was at the Leamington Show in 2011, and it has been displayed at many other events since.";
