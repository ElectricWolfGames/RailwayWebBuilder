            Description = "Oakhurst Town is a mythical station on the South Eastern Railway, set in the\r\nKent area in the 1880's. The idea is to convey the atmosphere and general\r\nappearance of the railway at that period. All except one building are over 20\r\nyears old, having been rescued from a previous larger layout. and the main-\r\nly scratch-built stock has been built over a period of 30 years or so, with\r\nsome items now available as kits. Operation of locos and turnouts is DCC.\r\nAlex Jackson couplings are Operated by permanent magnets, and the\r\nwhole layout plus two operators fits into a Skoda Octavia estate car. We are\r\nhappy to answer questions where we can";
