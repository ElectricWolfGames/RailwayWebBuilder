        Description = "The theme of my model built over the years, is based on the Kirkby Engine shed, yard and sidings with the Station on the Nottingham Worksop Line serving the movement of coal from local mines. Details are taken from drawings, measurements, and a collection of Photographs. The model buildings are about 1:87scale, some are reduced in length to be included on a similar representative scale with 00 gauge engines The model was developed and named 'Steaming back to Kirkby Loco' to become a reference for a project featuring the infrastructure of Railways and industry in Kirkby-in-Ashfield.
