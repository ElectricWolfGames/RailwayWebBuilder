        Description = "As a youngster, Ed Purcell lived in a house in the Gravelly Hill area of Birmingham until it was demolished to make way for the famous M6 interchange we all know colloquially as Spaghetti junction. That was in the 1960s, but the memory of his old familiar home lingered on, resurfacing when he needed a name for his latest N gauge layout set loosely in the same area. Gravelly Oak is a minimum space N gauge layout portraying the Privatization era using ready-to-run motive power. Class 60s and 66s operate the quarry traffic.";
