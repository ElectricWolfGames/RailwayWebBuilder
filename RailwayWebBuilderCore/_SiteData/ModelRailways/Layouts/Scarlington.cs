            Description = "Scarlington, or North of England Line 2 as it is also known. was built as a club layout but is now privately owned by the group of friends who built it after leaving our local club. It is set in the 1970/80s and has a flavour of various North Eastern landmarks. The two main bridges are similar to two of the bridges in Newcastle, the station roof was inspired by Darlington and various buildings (e.g. Woolworths and the Odeon Cinema) and the cliff lift are based on buildings in our home town of Scarborough. The stock we run on the layout is firmly set in the B.R. Blue diesel era, with the occasional steam special. There are various cameo scenes to keep the viewer occupied. There is also a game to play, which is listed on 2 of our noticeboards. where visitors can look for various items.";
