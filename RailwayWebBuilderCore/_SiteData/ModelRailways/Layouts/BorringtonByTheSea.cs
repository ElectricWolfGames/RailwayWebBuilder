        Description = "A fictitious location is the backdrop to this O gauge layout which depicts a diesel period railway on which heritage steam specials are run from time to time. The stock for the layout is rostered from many of the excellent 7mm/ft scale ready-to-run models now available from numerous manufacturers, including Heljan and Dapol. The scenery is all hand-made using a mix of kit- and scratch-built structures and scenic dressing from the Peco range of static grasses. A description of the the layout appears in the current Railway Modeller issue. ";
