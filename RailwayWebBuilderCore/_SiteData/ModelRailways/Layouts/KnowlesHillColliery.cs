            Description = "Knowles Hill Colliery is a fictitious colliery set as a tribute to the many collieries in the Nottinghamshire Coal Field. It represents what was, for well over a hundred years, an everyday occurrence of mined coal being brought to the surface then moved to sidings to be picked up and distributed around the Country by rail. This ended in 2015 with the closure of Thoresby - seeing the ending of coal mining in Nottinghamshire after 174 years. ";
