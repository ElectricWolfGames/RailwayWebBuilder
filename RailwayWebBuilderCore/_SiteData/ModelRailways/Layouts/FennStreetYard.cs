            Description = "When the warehouses and industrial area was built by the local Landowner and\r\nMP, Sir Jedidiah Mortlake, the nearby river was a convenient source for the move-\r\nment of goods. However. over time the river began to silt up making transport of\r\nsaid goods more difficult. Conveniently at this time the local mainline railway\r\ncompany proposed to build a branch line to a nearby town. Sir Jedidiah studying\r\nthe proposed route realised that by a smalt change of route his industrial area\r\ncould be connected to the mainline. but the railway company refused his sug-\r\ngestion. Outraged and determined to keep his business profitable and out of spite\r\nhe decided to build his own industrial railway from Fenn Street down to the\r\nbranch line, operated by his own locomotives. Fen St yard as depicted in the lay-\r\nout is now coming towards the end of its useful life. Sir Jedidiah is long gone. and\r\naccountants have taken over. For them the railway is not profitable so it will be\r\nrun down so that they have a convenient excuse to transfer any business left to\r\nroad transport. In reality the layout has been built to show that you don't need\r\nmasses of room to have an absorbing model railway in 0 gauge. The original lay-\r\nout builder has moved on to another layout and Fenn Street Yard was acquired.\r\nThis is our second layout available on the exhibition circuit and among our small\r\ncircle of friends two more are under construction!";
