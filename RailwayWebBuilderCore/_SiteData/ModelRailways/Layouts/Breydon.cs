            Description = "Breydon is imagined to be a small community named after a large expanse of water near Great Yarmouth. Its imaginary location is on a branch line leaving the main line somewhere between Breydon Junction and Berney Arms station. It is set in the late fifties/early sixties. The back scene has been painted to give the impression of the marshes surrounding the Yar-mouth area. Traffic consists of coal. fertilizer. seed and animal feed which are brought into the private siding of J.H.Bunn Ltd which is a local company. Most of these are conveyed in vans and open wagons. Passenger workings consist of tank and tender engines plus a single coach, sometimes with a single van. parcels van or milk tanker attached on the rear. Diesel Multiple Units and single diesel units may be seen in the area. Wednesday and Sat-urday see a more intensified service as these are market days in Great Yar-mouth and the attached van would be used to carry locally grown produce to market there.";
