            Description = "Here is a modern image layout set in the final years of British Rail (1990s) somewhere in West Yorkshire. The name is a play on words having a dig at the operator with little hair! The layout was designed to show off some kit built Electric Multiple Units (308 and 321). The passenger lines at the rear of the layout run on regular DC operation. There is also a selection of regular Diese! Multiple Units (150, 153, 155, 156 and 158) under the wires. The catenary is a hybrid of Dapol and Hornby International products. At the front of the layout there is a small maintenance depot with fuelling point and at the other end there is a small wagon repair depot. These are controlled by DCC (NCE Powercab) which allows light and sound to be used. The layout was built by Harrogate Model Railway Club and measures approximately 22ft x 2ft. The track is Peco code 100. There are a mixture of buildings from Hornby Skaledale and Bachmann Scenecraft. Locos and rolling stock are in the process of being finely detailed.";
