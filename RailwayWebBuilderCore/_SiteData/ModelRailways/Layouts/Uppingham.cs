        Description = "Uppingham is a model of an actual single line 3.5 mile spur from Seaton in Rutland which closed in 1960. The model is built to a scale of 3mm to 1ft and is not to be confused with T1120 which is not the same. The layout runs entirely on DC and uses vintage H&M point motor control with Gaugemaster controllers. The track is 3mm Society sleeper base with Peco HOm pointwork. All the buildings are scratch built-in card covered in embossed styrene. Rolling stock is a mixture of scratch-built, ready-made vintage Triang TT and kit-built items. ";
