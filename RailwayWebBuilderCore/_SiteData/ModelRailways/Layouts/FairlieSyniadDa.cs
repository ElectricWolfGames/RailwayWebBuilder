            Description = "The arrival of Bachmann's new 'OOg' narrow gauge model of the Ffestiniog Railway Double Fairlie 0-4-4-0Ts was all the catalyst the Hornby Magazine team needed to build a narrow gauge layout.. Having previous built a termi- nus station in 'OOg' this time we set out sights on a more ambitious project to create a continuous run scene in an 8ft x 2ft 6in footprint which encom- passes a main line run, passing loop station, a goods yard and a locomotive shed. The result is Fairlie Syniad Da - a Fairlie Good Idea translated from Welsh to English. The layout was built for features in Hornby Magazine and online through both KeyModelWorld and its associated YouTube channel where the team illustrates the build in words, pictures and video from start to finish.";
