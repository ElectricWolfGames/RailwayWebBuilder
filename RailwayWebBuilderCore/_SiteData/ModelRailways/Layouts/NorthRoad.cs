Totally fictitious, can be located anywhere you choose. All tracks are code 55 finescale Peco nickel silver streamline with unifrog points. Set in a busy market town in a low-level position providing all manner of running and shunting possibilities. 55+ Metcalfe kits, some detailed with guttering and down pipes, low relief and full size to create the town effect on the upper level where Faller 'N' gauge vehicles can be seen running.
