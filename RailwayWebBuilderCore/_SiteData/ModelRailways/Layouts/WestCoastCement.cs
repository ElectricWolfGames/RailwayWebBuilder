            Description = "This ‘00' gauge layout models a fictional section of the West Coast Main\r\nLine north of Crewe alongside a busy cement terminal. The double track\r\nmain line features overhead catenary as well as a goods loop which sees\r\nfreight trains pause to allow expresses to overtake.\r\n\r\nThe layout was built by the Hornby Magazine team in 2018 and now makes\r\noccasional exhibition appearances - its last being in 2022. Highlights of the\r\nlayout include Peco concrete sleeper code 75 track, Peco overhead cate-\r\nnary, a modified Walthers Valley Cement works plastic kit as the backdrop\r\nas well as a scratchbuilt loading dock. New additions for the Statfold show\r\nincluding a WCML relay room from the Key Model World Shop collection,\r\n3D printed axle counters and repopulation of the trees on the approach to\r\nthe storage yard after the level crossing. The entire layout is DCC controlled\r\nand features privatisation era locomotives and rolling stock spanning from\r\n2000 to the present day.";
