        Description = "St Johns is a South Devon branch line set in 1931 with Great Western steam locomotives hauling local and holiday passenger traffic, freight and milk trains along the fictitious line which is an imaginary extension of the Brixham branch line in the Torbay area. The layout is 00 gauge and measures 16 feet by 2 foot 6 on 4 base boards 4 feet long and was built as a memory of my late father John who was born in 1931 hence the layouts name and year modelled. The locos are all ready to run models and feature DCC sound adding to the experience when viewing the layout which also has background sounds of the sea waves. There are many things to look for on the layout which has been built to capture the area and is not just about the trains. We hope you enjoy your visit to the seaside and welcome any questions you have.";
