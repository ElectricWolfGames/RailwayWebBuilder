            Description = "The “Titfield Station & Film Set” layout is inspired by the Ealing Studios film\r\ncomedy, “TheTitheld Thunderbolt”. Filmed on location in June and July of 1952.\r\nthe movie was shot in various parts of Somerset. Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire\r\nand London. as well as in the Studio. The completed film was premiered in\r\nMarch 1953 (HM Queen's Coronation Year). Since the layout’s last exhibition\r\nappearance, when it used kit and scratch built rolling stock, with DC control. it\r\nhas been modified and extended to bring it up to modern standards. After the\r\nintroduction of the Rapido Trains “Titfield Thunderbolt Deluxe Train Pack”. the\r\nlayout is now operating with full sound and DCC digital control. Voice extracts,\r\ntaken from the film soundtrack. can be heard to match the action you can see in\r\nfront of you. The layout itself combines together some of the features and loca-\r\ntions found in the movie but brought together in one place. Look out for the\r\ncrowds waving from the bridge. the squire’s Bullnose Morris Cowley car, the\r\nsteam roller. the water-tower (a studio built prop.) and Pearse & Crump's bus.\r\nThe film crews are on hand with their cameras, flood-lights and recording gear\r\ntogether with the production personnel and studio mini bus.";
