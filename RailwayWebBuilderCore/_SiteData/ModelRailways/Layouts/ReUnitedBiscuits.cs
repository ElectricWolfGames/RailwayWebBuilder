Bags of broken biscuits of various makers, enter the yard in open wagons with makers' name on the side and are shunted into the factory where they are mended or even reunited! Once they have been repaired, they are then shunt back to the shops for sale in closed wagons. There us a local train service over the viaduct for both passenger and freight, The station is named Mendham. Two lorries distribute goods and supplies to the busi- nesses around the town which may be anything from biscuit adhesive to staples for the office! There are several cameos on the layout showing peo- ple going about their own lives including one on the canal, where 2 boats are on a collision course and the pub barmaid who is expecting a phone call from. The GPO appear to be fixing a fault on the phone box opposite the loco shed or is he phoning the barmaid?!";
