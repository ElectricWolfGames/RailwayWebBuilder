            Description = "Granby lane is a colliery based in the North Derbyshire/South Yorkshire\r\ncoalfield area and features an operational loading system for the wagons.\r\nso an empty train will arrive, refill and depart fully loaded back on mainline,\r\noften with the next set of empties waiting to access the pit yard from the\r\nmainline. All shunting of wagons within the colliery is undertaken by the\r\nNBCs own locos. The mainline also has a frequent procession of trains with\r\nlocal. express, parcels and freight passing by. A loop line has been installed\r\nand this allows freight trains to be held while a faster passenger train over-\r\ntakes it. All these moves are fully signalled. Granby lane itself features ter-\r\nraced housing. a pub and a small scrapyard. look for the detail included in\r\nthis area which includes many cameos such as the dustcart crew emptying\r\nthe bins and a children’s playground. The pit itself has working winding gear\r\nand loading screens as well as other buildings and NCB vehicles. They pre-\r\nsent a grimy coaldust covered atmosphere to show how it was in our 1960s\r\nrepresentation of the coal mine era.\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy viewing our layout, feel free to ask any questions which\r\nwill do our best to answer.\r\n\r\nThe layout is 16ft x 8ft and requires a footprint of 2oft x 10ft. it has a flame-\r\nproof curtain and fully pat tested electrics.";
