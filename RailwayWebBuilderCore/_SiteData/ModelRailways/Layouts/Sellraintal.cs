            Description = "Sellraintal is an Austrian N gauge DCC layout. Set in the Sellraintal Valley just outside Innsbruck in the Tyrol region of Austria. Unfortunately the railway never actually reached the valley in real life, so this is very much a 'what could have been' project. It assumes it was originally built to service silver mines and quarries further up the valley, with the passenger service following much later in order to take workers from the local area up to the mines and quarries. Sadly the industries closed down once the workings were exhausted and the line was truncated at the largest station on the route. It continued to serve the growing number of skiers flocking to the locality to ski tour around the nearby mountains. Hence the layout is based on the winter season. The scenic section is 8ft x 1ft leading to a 3ft fiddle yard arranged in an L shape. Sellraintal utilizes mostly German or Austrian models for trackwork, stock and scenic items. ";
