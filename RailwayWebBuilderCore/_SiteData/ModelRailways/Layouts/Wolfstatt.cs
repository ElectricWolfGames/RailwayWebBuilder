It is modelled in HO and is based on present day Austria depicting a high alpine main line. This is Wolfstatt’s first year on the exhibition circuit, and this year’s Soar Valley Model Railway Club’s show is our second outing with the layout.</br></br>" +

Block trains, multi model, wagon load freight, regional, and international express traffic can all be seen, — several double headed rakes are to be spotted. All of this is controlled by our home developed Wi-Fi system using smart phones and a gauge master prodigy.";
