            Description = "This little project is based loosely on a prototype which existed dose to the real Callenon. north of Newcastle upon Tyne. Employing a two piece main baseboard and using the proscenium arch style presentation with a semi permanently attached top casing with integral curved back scene, the main business end of Callaton is a skimpy 6- (76an) long baseboard with two detachable fiddle yards, one at each end. The right-hand fiddle yard takes the form de 13 inch (33an) sector plate fed from a hidden siding at the rear behind the back scene. The left-hand side has an 8-inch (20cm) fiddle yard simply to allow rail traffic on the scenic section to temporally disappear bff scene. Locomotives and stock on this small project represent the 1980s period and as such are mostly Bachmann diesels that have either had the wheels machined to 2FS standards or have had their wheels changed using drop-in replacements from the 2mm Scale Association shops. Rolling stock is a mixture of converted RTR and kit built and delayed action uncoupling using the 'Electra Coupling' designed in 1979 by fellow 2mm Scale Association member John Whitehead. \r\nThis little piece has been planned so that it can be operated using up to date control with DCC but it is also capable of operation using traditional DC analogue control. Also. and probably unusually, it can operate on battery power in both DCC and DC. The intention is to show it is not necessary to have vast space or inordinate funds to model in 2FS.";
