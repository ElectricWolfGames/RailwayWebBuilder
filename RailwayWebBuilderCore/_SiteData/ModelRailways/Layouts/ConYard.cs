        Description = "Throughout the 1970s, vast numbers of British Railways diesel hydraulic locos anived at Swindon works for disposal, some barely 10 years old. The layout is a condensed representation of the works area known as the Con Yard. With lines of withdrawn locos and rolling stock, the large corrugated \"C* shop and the two electric gantry cranes, the scene is set for a look back in time at a seldom modelled part of British Rail history.";
