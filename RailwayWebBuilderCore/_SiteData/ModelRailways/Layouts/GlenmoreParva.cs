            Description = "It is a fictional location and with no allegiance to any particular region or company and a time around the change from steam to diesel operation. This is to suit members' stock and interests and is an end to end layout which is double tracked into a ten lane fiddle yard.  This gives the opportunity to have passing trains, not always seen on an end to end layout. The terminus station \"Glenmore Parva\" has two main platforms with a central loco release line and a bay platform for local service to \"Shepshed\". The station also has a small goods yard and private line to local industry area, which runs down under the main lines to the rear of the layout. There is an operational turntable to enable locos to be turned and make the return journey from the station to the fiddle yard.";
