            Description = "Heanor South represents a real Great Northern branch line terminus that opened in 1891. As can be seen from the track layout the line was intended to carry on further but lack of finance prevented this. Our version represents the line had it survived intact until the British Railways era. Much research was done to model the line although some compression has taken place on the layout to allow some features to be included.";
