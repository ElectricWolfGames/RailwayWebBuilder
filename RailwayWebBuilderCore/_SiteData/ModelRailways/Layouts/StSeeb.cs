The layout is based on a small town in the North West and has a small station on a single-line system. The layout has a working level crossing and semaphore signals fitted. There are various cameo scenes on the layout including the local fire brigade in action along with a busy market scene. Most buildings have been fitted out with internal lighting including the signal box which has been detailed inside. SMP Markway track and points have been installed, points are operated via slow-operating Cobalt motors. The track has been ballasted with good old tea leaves! The layout is operated by DCC using a Lenz system and all locomotives and DMU's have been fitted with sound.";
