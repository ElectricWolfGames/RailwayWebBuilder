        Description = "Ilfracombe East is the terminus of a fictitious Blackmoor Gate — Ilfracombe branch of the L&BR. The L&B did, in its early years, operate a bus service along this route using Milnes-Daimler petrol vehicles. Following prosecution for exceeding the 8mph limit, the L&B chairman, Sir George Newnes, discontinued the service and sold the buses to the Great Western Railway. The layout is set in the “Southern” period (1923 — 1935), but a number of the vehicles retain their old L&B colours.</br></br>" +
            "  Other stock may be seen, operating through Minehead — Ilfracombe services. These run over the equally fictitious Minehead & Lynmouth Railway, which joins the L&B at Barbrook Junction, just outside Lynton. Interestingly, an abortive GWR backed scheme was proposed for a 2ft gauge Minehead & Lynmouth line, around 1900.</br></br>" +
            "  In addition, there are a number of locomotives, railcars and other items of rolling stock, representing developments which might have happened if closure had not taken place in 1935.";
