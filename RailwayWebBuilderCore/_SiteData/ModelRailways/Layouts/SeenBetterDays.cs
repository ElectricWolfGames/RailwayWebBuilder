        Description = "'Seen Better Days' is a miniature railway within a N gauge setting, built in 2020/21 on an old over the bed table. Once a thriving area the miniature railway was laid down in the local park and is about to close as the whole area is to be redeveloped. Like many miniature railways it will disappear for good. It has decided to stay open for the rest of the season even though other attractions have recently closed, or are about to close. The railway museum has already closed, and the owner of the boats for the boating lake is closing down due to lack of customers.";
