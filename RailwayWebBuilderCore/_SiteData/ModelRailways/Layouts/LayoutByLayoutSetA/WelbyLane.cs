            Description = "WELBY LANE R.T.CTRACTION AND ROLLING STOCK MAINTENANCE DEPOTPRESENTED BY MARK PEARSON - MEMBER OF SDEGWith the continuing development in the 1970s of the Railway Technical Centre at Derby itwas decided that minor repairs and servicing could be managed at the site of the Test trackwithout the need for a return to Derby or Toton.Welby Lane lies just off the Old Dalby test track at the Asfordby end, in fact, the spur stillexists into the Asfordby Business Park, originally part of the Great Northern Line north andseveral quarries in the area. The R.T.C decided that the spur provided an excellent area tobuild a maintenance facility and with the nearby quarry reception sidings gained additionalstorage space whilst still giving access to the main test track and main line.The scale is OO, using fine-scale and peco code 75 track and points. In fact, the layout wasbuilt in two halves and then also an extension was added sometime later! The original shed areais much older and was built as a small test bed for DCC and code 75 track, The newer 'exreception sidings area' was built some years after with the scrapyard extension being recentlybuilt. The overall length is now just over 20 feet in length by 2 feet wide maximum. Controlis by Lenz DCC, using an express net to enable more than one operator to use the layout. Slowaction point motors are Cobolt, Traintronics, or Fulgrex. Lights and accessories are fromvarious propriety suppliers and sources.All the locomotives are sound-fitted fitted giving an extra dimension, especially to some of the oddclasses of diesels that sadly are no longer around, Due to the diversity of the R.T.C constantlyexperimenting and developing, some items of stock seen on Welby Lane may only be correctfor 'that one day in time', and due to the secrecy and lack of photographic evidence ofcertain prototypes, some items have had to be modeled as such from what we can see/know.Some of the buildings on the layout are based on actual structures on the Mickleover and OldDalby test tracks - even down to the guard dog compound at Mickleover. The office blockand A.P.T testing house are inspired by the structures at Old Dalby,and have been eitherscratch built or by modifying kits to suit."; // TODO Needs description
