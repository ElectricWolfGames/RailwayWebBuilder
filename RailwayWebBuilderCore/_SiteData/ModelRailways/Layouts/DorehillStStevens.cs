            Description = "This fictitious layout built to 4mm/0o gauge is based in the South York- shire/North Midland area between 1957/ 1962, allowing us to run both steam and early diesels from the BR Midlands period with visiting stock from the Eastern and Western regions. </br></br>" +
                "Stock is a mixture of kit built and RTR. Fitting crew and lamps to the locos and real coal in the tenders is on going. All express passenger trains are close coupled. </br></br>" +
                "The operating signals are a mixture of semaphore and two aspect coloured light. All track work is Peco code 100. This layout is controlled by analogue dc; the eleven operators use seven control panels and twelve controllers We try to take a crew of fifteen to exhibitions so operators get a break once ina while. Train movements are to a schedule for passenger and fast freight. The goods yard and slow freight work independently. Most of the buildings are scratch built although some modified Skaledale have recently appeared";
