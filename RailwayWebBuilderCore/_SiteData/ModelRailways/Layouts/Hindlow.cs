            Description = "The scenic part of the layout reflects an impression of the two-mile stretch of line between the Hindlow tunnel (north end) and the cattle bridge near Harpur Hill. At the tunnel end of the line is the former Beswick Lime Works followed by the road bridge and then the former LNWR station and goods yard. The line then goes into a short cutting past a fragment of the former Ryan Sommerville Limestone Quarry and finally ends at the cattle bridge where one track leads up the Harpur Hill branch and two tracks lead to Buxton. The model is a testament to all those who worked in the area and to those who have aided us with the research for this project. A single track still exists today from Buxton along this route and through the tunnel to the Hindlow Quarries and is still in regular use. The era we are depicting saw local passenger trains between Ashbourne and Buxton (these ceased in 1953), light mixed local freight mainly between Uttoxeter and Buxton and high-volume lime products are available between the quarries and all areas of the UK. Also, the quarries needed a regular supply of coal from the nearby coalfields. Shunting plays a significant part in the layout within the area of the Beswick Lime Works, the Station Yard, and the branch to the Harpur Hill Quarries. Rolling stock is mainly LMS and former LNWR ready to run with several scratch-built wagons.";
