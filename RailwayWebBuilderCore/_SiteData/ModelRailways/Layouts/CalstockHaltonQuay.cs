        Description = "Because of the lath of port facilities the mines around Ca!stock and Kit Hill found difficulty in expanding. Flatten Quay was opened up primarily so that more ore could be exported to South Wales. However, due to silting, the new port was not the success it was hoped, and the last ore was exported via the East Cornwall Minerals Railway and Halton Quay in 1908. Halton Quay does exist to this day. The railways at Halton Quay are actually pure fiction: however the model does set out to portray accurately what a small port of the period would have looked like. We have tried to show the small industries that were so important to a port, such as the boat builders. the sail makers, the rope works etc. as well as the basic railway facilities that would have existed.";
