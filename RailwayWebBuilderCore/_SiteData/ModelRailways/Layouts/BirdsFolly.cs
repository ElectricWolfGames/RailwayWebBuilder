            Description = "This layout represents the western end of the Southwold Railway in 1914. The Southwold Railway had just taken delivery of a powerful new locomotive - Manning Wardle 0-6-2 tank No 4 Wenhaston. This was stabled in a wood and asbestos engine shed on a spur off the siding at the railway-owned gravel pit near Bird's Folly, Halesworth. The bridge complete with a length of track can still be seen to this day and Folly house is still to be found on the brow of the Holton Road. Engines No. 1 Southwold, No 2 Halesworth and no 4 Wenhaston are all Golden Arrow white metal kits on an N gauge chassis. Carriage and good vehicles are by Worsley Works, Nine Lines, and Golden Arrow.";
