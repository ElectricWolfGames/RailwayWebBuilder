            Description = "At the southern end of its tunnel through the Alps in Switzerland the Gotthard line emerges into the Italian-speaking Swiss Canton of Ticino. We're in the 1990's at the small town of Tamaro near the Italian border, with its station on a single-track section of the line with a passing loop and basic goods facilities. There are regular local stopping services, and through international passenger and freight trains to and from Italy. You may also see an occasional special excursion hauled by a preserved locomotive such as a legendary Swiss crocodile. Across the road a metre-gauge light railway runs a regular shuttle service along the valley, and the efficient Swiss postal coaches are waiting at the station";
