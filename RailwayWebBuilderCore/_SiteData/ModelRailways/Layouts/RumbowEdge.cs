        Description = "Originally built by Mac Strong and subsequently donated to the Club, it now forms part of the Club's 'odd-scale' group. It depicts a narrow gauge preserved the line built in a large abandoned quarry. The part modeled is supposedly the least accessible area of the quarry being used between 1939 and 1942 for the storage of museum valuables. During that time tracks were laid into nunderground galleries. After the war, the quarry never returned to full production and was abandoned, though later it was taken over by a Mining and Quarrying Heritage Society which, over the years, re-laid the track and opened parts of the quarry as a museum. The Society owns an eclectic collection of machinery, locomotives, and stock that requires varied degrees of attention from time to time. The hidden nature of the area modeled was found to be the ideal secure area for this work, whilst the line passing this area gives access to some of the galleries open to the public view. A passing loop provides a convenient place for trains to pass, or await access to the galleries. The layout is built on five boards totaling 3m x 1m overall. It is usually operated from one end. The circular track plan allows something to run whilst chatting to visitors at exhibitions, or just to watch trains go by. Control is DCC using the NCE system and the track is from Peco, laid with a minimum curve of 17 ins.";
