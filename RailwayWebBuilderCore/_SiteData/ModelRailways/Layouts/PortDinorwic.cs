            Description = "Built by Great Model Railway Challenge judge Kathy Millatt. Port Dinorwic.,\r\nas seen on Hornby - A Modet World on the Yesterday TV channel. this lay-\r\nout is now in the care of the Bala Lake Railway. Port Dinorwic is the slate\r\nwharf where the products of the giant Dinorwic state quarry were sent via\r\nthe 4 gauge Padarn railway and from there shipped around the world. 110\r\n3/4\" gauge slate wagons were carried on 4 gauge transporter wagons\r\nfrom Gilfach Odu to Penscoins, from where they were lowered down to Port\r\nDinorwic on an incline. The model shows a small part of the port where the\r\nincline finishes in a tunnel behind the buildings in the middle. in addition to\r\nthe narrow gauge lines (009), there is also a standard gauge branch line (00)\r\nto the port running through the middle of the layout.";
