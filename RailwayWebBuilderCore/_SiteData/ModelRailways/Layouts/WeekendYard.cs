            Description = "Weekend Yard was built over the two days of the 2023 Gauge O Guild's show at Stafford to demonstrate that an O gauge layout offers plenty of operating opportunities within a small space could be constructed using off-the-shelf products and components in a weekend. It also showed that a modeler does not need a huge space, pots of money and vast model engineering experience to create something in 7mm scale that fits into a shed or a small bedroom in a modern house. The track plan was based on Bankfield Road, a layout which was featured in the Gauge O Guild publication Small Layouts Volume 3 and the October 2018 issue of Railway Modeller. The Guild is very grateful to Peco and all of the retailers who donated products for the build team to use, and to the Railway Modeller for publicising the project. ";
