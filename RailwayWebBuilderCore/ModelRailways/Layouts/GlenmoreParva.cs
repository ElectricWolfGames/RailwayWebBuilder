This\r\nis to suit members' stock and interests and is an end to end layout which is\r\ndouble tracked into a ten lane fiddle yard.\r\n\r\nThis gives the opportunity to have passing trains, not always seen on an end\r\nto end layout. The terminus station \"Glenmore Parva\" has two main\r\nplatforms with a central loco release line and a bay platform for local service to \"Shepshed\".\r\nThe station also has a small goods yard and private line to local industry area, which runs down under the main\r\nlines to the rear of the layout. There is an operational turntable to enable locos to be turned and make the return journey from the station to the fiddle yard.";
