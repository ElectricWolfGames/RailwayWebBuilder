            Description = "Set in North Wales based on a typical slate quarry dressing mill in the hills of Snowdonia. Melin Llechi has all the flavour of a once common scene in many of the slate quarries in the area. The period covered is between 1950 up to the 1970's a time when the quarries were buzzing to the sounds of various little locomotives scurrying about shifting the newly quarried rock to the mills for splitting & dressing into finished slates to help roof the world All locos are controlled using radio control via mobile devices therefore not requiring any power to the track.
