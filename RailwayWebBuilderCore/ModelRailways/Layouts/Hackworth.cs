            Description = "Hackworth (Trafalgar Terrace) is a model of a typical British Railways Western Region large Motive Power Depot (MPD) with both a Churchward Straight Shed, Roundhouse, Maintenance shed and coaling tower. The MPD is surrounded by a locomotive works. Although the location is fictitious it represents an area around Bordesley on the ex-Great Western mainline East of Moor Street in Birmingham. Surrounding the MPD there is a backscene which represents a typical railway workshop complex. The lay- out features sound fitted locomotives, a working turntable and subtle light- ing and sound effects. Locomotives are mostly ex-Great Western types Kings, Castles and Halls down to small pannier tanks, some are in workaday grime and some in ex-works condition. To add variety some of the locomo- tives preserved in running order by the British Transport Commission make the occasional entrance together with some exotic locomotives on inter- regional workings. The layout incorporates lighting and sound effects and a working turntable. All locomotives are DCC Sound fitted.";
