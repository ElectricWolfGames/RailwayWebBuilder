            Description = "The O gauge layout started with the original idea showcasing the\r\nCharnwood Forest Line Loughborough Derby Road Station which led out to\r\na viaduct in a straight up and down configuration. After a lot of thought and\r\nwith the hope of doing something different we decided that although the\r\nLMNW line closed to passenger traffic in 1931 we tried to envisage what it\r\nwould have been like in the late 1950s early 1960s if the line had remained\r\nopened.\r\n\r\nOur original idea was developed and with much discussion it was decided that\r\nthe layout should increase in size and that it would contain 4 major view\r\npoints, a) Loughborough Derby Road Station would remain but would now\r\ninclude a goods shed,turn table and M.P.D. b) Whitwick Station would now be\r\nincluded with an additional platform to allow passing passenger trains (this\r\nwas included for running and interest purposes). c) a goods yard with the\r\nappropriate goods loading dock, d) Grace Dieu Viaduct with its intricate stone\r\nand brick work leading through a bridge into the fiddle yard.";
