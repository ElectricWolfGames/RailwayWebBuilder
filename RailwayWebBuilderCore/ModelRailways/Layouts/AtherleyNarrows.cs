            Description = "Since visiting Toronto in Canada in 1990 and 1994, I have built two layouts\r\nbased on the trains I saw then and in particular those of the Canadian\r\nPacific railway or CP Rail as it was then. It is inspired by a photograph I had\r\ntaken of a swing bridge at Atherley near\r\nOrillia in Ontario. My initial thought was\r\nto build a simple diorama of the bridge\r\nand its approach piers, but it soon\r\nexpanded and I can now run 20ft long\r\ntrains. The track plan for Atherley\r\nNarrows allows for industries to be\r\nserved from loops off the main line and\r\nthese can be operated at the same\r\ntime as trains pass on the main.";
