                " The track plan of the terminus at Seaton offered good operating potential; main platform, bay, engine shed and goods yard. This also had an interesting location right along the river estuary. However rather than simply follow this plan, we have made Axmouth a *mirror-image' to place it on the opposite bank - the name Axmouth was chosen as it sounds suitable railway-like and the river is next to the Axe. Other SR stock was added to the fleet so the setting for Axmouth is in the late-1930s. </br></br>" +
                " The two baseboards are 18\" x 36\" giving a 6' scenic length so the Seaton plan had to be compressed - the real thing could accommodate quite long holiday trains. However, the main platform can still take a three coach branch train plus a T9. The buildings are from the Bachmann \"Shillingstone\" range and add nicely to the SR country feel. We both have an interest is SR EMU's so Axmouth has been given 3rd rail but just into the bay - this is part of a SR test for rural electrification. Had the second war not intervened, much more of the ex-SR lines would have been electrified. Anyway it is an excuse to run the superb Hornby 2-BIL.";

The premise is that the colliery is at the end of its life with the lower screens closing down and only the top screens in use. The only problem is that feeder road to the upper screens has been closed by subsidence so a link line had to be made to the lower line. This gave me the multi-level layout that you do not often see in O gauge.  The engines are all kit built from various manufacturers except one 03 from Brassworks. The wagons are all kits, mainly Parkside Dundas with a couple of Slaters and Piercy.  The colliery buildings are all scratchbuilt from foamboard with brick and stonework from Slaters and window frames from Highland castings. The track is all Peco, the point motors are from Conrad.";
