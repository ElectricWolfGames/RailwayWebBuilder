The era is LMS pre-grouping but ambiguous as to which\r\nconstituent company in order to allow the layout to accommodate Midland,\r\nLNW and North Staffordshire stock. The layout incorporates a small\r\nsandstone quarry and iron ore mine. In the quarry, wagons are filled with\r\nstone and hauled by aprivate\r\nrailway locomotive down to a\r\nheadshunt where they are\r\nexchanged with mainline railway\r\ncompany engines for the final\r\nleg into the station. The ore is\r\ndelivered to wagons using a\r\nmine train which operates fully\r\nautomatically - loading, moving\r\nand unloading without the touch\r\nof human hand!";
