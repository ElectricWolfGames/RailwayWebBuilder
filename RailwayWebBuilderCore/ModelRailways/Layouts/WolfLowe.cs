            Description = "Wolfe Lowe is a small terminus station located somewhere in Staffordshire Moorlands. The era is LMS pre-grouping but ambiguous as to which constituent company in order to allow the layout to accommodate Midland, LNW and North Staffordshire stock. The layout incorporates a small sandstone quarry and iron ore mine. In the quarry, wagons are filled with stone and hauled by aprivate railway locomotive down to a headshunt where they are exchanged with mainline railway company engines for the final leg into the station. The ore is delivered to wagons using a mine train which operates fully automatically - loading, moving and unloading without the touch of human hand!";
