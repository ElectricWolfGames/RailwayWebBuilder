            Description = "Tytton Hall Yard is the Exhibition Layout built by the Boston Model Railway Society. Whilst we try to represent the 1980's and 90's period, as a small group of modellers with many interests the stock layout doesn't always fol- low one particular era or area. However, we do have the rule that all stock must match its locomotive. Therefore, the locos and stock they are pulling will be correct for their era of operation. Our primary aim is to keep some- thing moving at all times. The layout features a coal concentration yard. This is situated below a secondary mainline where it's reducing from four tracks to double track to cross a bridge. Rakes of MGR coal hoppers are brought to the yard empty to be loaded by the working loading tower. This has been entirely 3D Printed including the operating mechanism. This is driven by a servo that is controlled from an Arduino Microcontroller. Opera- tors operate the mechanism using an electronic switch. The timing of the operation is manually controlled by the operator and it's possible to load wagons on the move. All track is Peco Code 100 ballasted with fine 'N Gauge' ballast. Code 100 was chosen to allow older RTR stock to be run if required. The layout is operated using the Lenz LH100 DCC system and is split into three power districts. Many locomotives are fitted with Sound De- coders depending on the members present. If you have any questions about the layout, it's construction, loader operation or DCC system. Then please do not hesitate to ask, we're happy to answer any questions you may have";
