            Description = "Hartley Poole Too is set fictitiously somewhere on the Somerset Levels in\r\nthe middle years of the Second World War. The central feature is a coal-fired\r\npower station, with modellers' licence allowing an early form of merry-go-\r\nround bringing coal in to the site and taking ash away in the “same” train.\r\nThe power station has a cooling tower which has live steam emitted from it. </br>" +
                "\r\n\r\nThe boiler room has a chimney emitting real smoke. To the east lies an army\r\ncamp which houses a variety of military vehicles prior to D-Day 1944, and\r\nboasts hospital and NAFFI Nissen huts. The camp is served by a small\r\ncountry station which has a two-track GWR main line, off which a siding can\r\naccommodate such wagons as tank-transporting warwells and warflats. To\r\nthe west lies a battery of anti-\r\naircraft guns with two functioning\r\nsearch lights. Towards the rear is a\r\nrifle range. At the far end is a\r\nshot-down German aircraft which\r\nhas crashed into a cottage with\r\nsmoke emanating from it. The pilot\r\nawaits capture by advancing Home\r\nGuard.</br></br>" +
                "\r\n\r\nAgainst the scenic break board\r\nruns a high level shuttle for a diesel\r\nrailcar. The line appears from off-\r\nstage on the west and runs along\r\nan embankment, behind the power\r\nstation, over an arched viaduct to a\r\nhigh level halt at the east end. A\r\ndetached’ siding serves a\r\ngunpowder store. In the foreground\r\nis a river scene with naval craft and\r\nbankside railway tracks for militia.";
