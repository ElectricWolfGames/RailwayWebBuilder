            Description = "We are in the railway backwater of Smallwood a town somewhere in England with a terminal station that has seen better days. Much of the glass has long since gone from the all over station roof and the provision of four platforms are from an era of far more affluent times than the current general run-down appearance. The station still boasts a parcel depot as well as a small stabling point for DMU's. The future will see further rationalization as the Sprinter trains are introduced in the 1980s and the parcel depot is closed.</br></br>" +
                "At a slightly lower level below the station are the remains of another station that now serve as exchange sidings for several local industrial concerns. These sidings would only just see out the 1970's becoming part of the town's bypass road. The layout has been built as a test bed for a much larger layout based in the same blue diesel era.";
