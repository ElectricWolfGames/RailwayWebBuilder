            Description = "Barnwood is a fictional location in northwest England on a loop line off the West Coast Mainline between Preston and Lancaster. It is on the coast with a small port with regular connections to the Isle of Man and Northern Ireland.  The town is busy with passing freight as it acts as a second route between Preston and Lancaster relieving pressure on this two track section of West Coast Mainline. Passenger services are worked by Regional Railways trains running to and from Preston and Barrow in Furness. There is a short branch line to Glasson on the estuary of the River Lune.";
