It is on the coast with\r\na small port with regular connections to the Isle of Man and Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe town is busy with passing freight as it acts as a second route between\r\nPreston and Lancaster relieving pressure on this two track section of West\r\nCoast Mainline. Passenger services are worked by Regional Railways trains\r\nrunning to and from Preston and Barrow in Furness. There is a short branch\r\nline to Glasson on the estuary of the River Lune.";
