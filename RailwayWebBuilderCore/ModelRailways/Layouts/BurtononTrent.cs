Scenic\r\nelements are an amalgamation of what could be seen around the station\r\nduring the time period with no fixed date. This, | believe, forms into a\r\npleasing model location with plenty of points of interest and enough\r\nnostalgia to hopefully jog the better memories of the locals from the time. As\r\na result, stock is also included that reflects typical services that could be\r\nseen passing the area during those years.";
