            Description = "The layout is set over a 5 year period ranging from 1988 to 1993. Scenic elements are an amalgamation of what could be seen around the station during the time period with no fixed date. This, I believe, forms into a pleasing model location with plenty of points of interest and enough nostalgia to hopefully jog the better memories of the locals from the time. As a result, stock is also included that reflects typical services that could be seen passing the area during those years.";
