            Description = "Illie Town is a small modern image layout based in Cheshire. Passenger\r\nservices are operated by ARRIVA WALES and EAST MIDLANDS. On the\r\nfreight side, there is a ballast siding and a warehouse that imports steel,\r\nwhich are served by a variety of locos from different companies. There is a\r\ntwo-road loco depot with a separate fuelling point. The layout is over 20\r\nyears old and has been on the exhibition circle previously known as Bridge\r\nStreet but a lot of work has gone into making it Illie Town. Though the track\r\nplan is pretty much the same, we added the bay platform, fueling point and\r\nwarehouse for added interest, along with new background scenery. Fully\r\nwired for DCC and controlled by NCC power cab, all turnouts and signals\r\nare by normal analogue.";
