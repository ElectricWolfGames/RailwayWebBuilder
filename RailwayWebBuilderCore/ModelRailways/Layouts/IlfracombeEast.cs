            Description = "Ilfracombe East is the terminus of a fictitious Blackmoor Gate — Ilfracombe\r\nbranch of the L&BR. The L&B did, in its early years, operate a bus service\r\nalong this route using Milnes-Daimler petrol vehicles. Following prosecution\r\nfor exceeding the 8mph limit, the L&B chairman, Sir George Newnes,\r\ndiscontinued the service and sold the buses to the Great Western Railway.\r\nThe layout is set in the “Southern” period (1923 — 1935), but a number of the\r\nvehicles retain their old L&B colours.</br></br>" +
                "\r\n\r\nOther stock may be seen, operating through Minehead — Ilfracombe\r\nservices. These run over the equally fictitious Minehead & Lynmouth\r\nRailway, which joins the L&B at Barbrook Junction, just outside Lynton.\r\nInterestingly, an abortive GWR backed scheme was proposed for a 2ft\r\ngauge Minehead & Lynmouth line, around 1900.</br></br>" +
                "\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are a number of locomotives, railcars and other items of\r\nrolling stock, representing developments which might have happened if\r\nclosure had not taken place in 1935.";
