            Description = "Join us at Rockcliffe to revisit the glamour and excitement of the age of steam. At the bustling, noisy Rockcliffe mainline station you will see the famous Flying Scotsman, Royal Scot, Golden Arrow, Cornish Rivera Express and the international Night Ferry to Paris Gare du Nord. As the signal turns green and the whistle blows, we board our train. In the Dining Car, glasses tinkle and cutlery rattles as our train departs and speeds through rugged, picturesque countryside. For a more relaxed experience, go to Platforms 7 or 8 for the quaint narrow gauge railway, puffing and threading its way through a landscape of mountains, tunnels and bridges to Lakeside and the Regency Spa town of Rockcliffe. Hear the male voice choir and Welsh Guards brass band playing in the bandstand or maybe relax in the Swan Inn with its old world charm and hospitality.";
