            Description = "Join us at Rockcliffe to revisit the glamour and excitement of the age of steam.\r\nAt the bustling, noisy Rockcliffe mainline station you will see the famous Flying\r\nScotsman, Royal Scot, Golden Arrow, Cornish Rivera Express and the\r\ninternational Night Ferry to Paris Gare du Nord. As the signal turns green and\r\nthe whistle blows, we board our train. In the Dining Car, glasses tinkle and\r\ncutlery rattles as our train departs and speeds through rugged, picturesque\r\ncountryside. For a more relaxed experience, go to Platforms 7 or 8 for the\r\nquaint narrow gauge railway, puffing and threading its way through a\r\nlandscape of mountains, tunnels and bridges to Lakeside and the Regency\r\nSpa town of Rockcliffe. Hear the male voice choir and Welsh Guards brass\r\nband playing in the bandstand or maybe relax in the Swan Inn with its old\r\nworld charm and hospitality.";
